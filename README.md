# type-ahead

Starting this new Type Ahead project. 

I've simply satarted with the form and styling for now. 

JS Type Ahead:
- Simple fetch request here where we push our results to an array
- We created a function that takes in a word we want to match, in this case a city or state and we created a Regex to match against the cities and states in our array 

Thank you,
